[@Description]
Recently we have discovered a new area called 
{AncientRuins/Yellow}.  However,the olny way 
to go there is by going through EvilHeart. 
As you can see, I cant't go throught EvilHeart 
due to all the monsters in there. Therefore, 
I'm here trying to create a force that will 
defeat the monsters. So.. will you be able to help me 
out by killing the monsters inside of {RedCave/Yellow}? 
If are less monsters then the force will be able to 
complete their task more easily.
