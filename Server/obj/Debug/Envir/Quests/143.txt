A long time ago, a certain villain stole our
HolySword, the best sword of our school, This 
sword was so Holy that there is a legend, that 
when it smashes once storm blows and dragons 
appear well... who knows it is true or not? But 
if the sword exist Its power will be so huge that 
we can not estimate its range.
