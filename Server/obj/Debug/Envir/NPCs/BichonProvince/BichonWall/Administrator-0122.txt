When you request guild war, names of allies will appear in blue,
on the other side, enemy names will appear orange.
If you are connected during a Guild War, the message:
'War with {nnn} guild' will appear in chatting window and
if you kill a member of the enemy guild you will not
be regarded as PK.

Guildwar cannot take place in village.
It can be executed out of certain ranges from the

However, if you are PK your ID will be red in colour,
even during war.
