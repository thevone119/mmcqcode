In a book written 100 years ago,there is a section where it
explainshow to enter hell. It is said the patch to hell was discovered
past the BorderVillage. To investigate this area, we have prepared
many investigators. If you'd like to see this place too, you should go
ask their leader.
Also you will need the Bichon Token to go thought the cave.
