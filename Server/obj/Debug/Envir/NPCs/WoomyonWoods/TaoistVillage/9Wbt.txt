Come here, pal!
I have been waiting for you a long time..
 
It's your destiny you never escape from it even after you die....
Ah friend, Will you take my orders and get through the hard way?
 
<I'll follow your orders with pleasure/@Quest1>

[@Quest1]
#SAY
Well. This is my duty. This is why i have waited for you instead of
leaving here You came here with a JadeCrystal.. My name is Abel,
and my nickname was Thunderman before i died. Originally I had
striven for martial art training since I was 5 years old When I was
30 years old I was never scared of anyone in the world Then I was 
arrogant for I took a pride in my martial art, consequently it made 
me a lot of enemies. But I was no longer interested in community life

[@Quest2]
#SAY
So I disappeared from the sight of people to look for stronger monsters
I finally reached the highest floor of the RedMoon Valley, no one had
been until then And I found something in a ugly, wet, shady and 
bad-smelling room... It's the Crystal of huge demon. Filled with hatred...
anger... uncontrollably the rough heartbeasts of mad and murderous
monster beat within it... Its power was so strong that I was frightened
and scared of it and I thought I should try to kill it anyhow
<That's why you need the HolySword./@Quest3>

[@Quest3]
#SAY
Your right. I tried hiring a HolySword, the best sword of all, from
the taoist school located below the mountain. But they didn't trust me
for I had a bad reputation at that time. So they expelled me from there
It made me angry and I extorted the sword by force of arms.
I came here with the sword but... It seems to have been the first
wrong step. My mind was still filled with arrogance at that time.

[@Quest4]
#SAY
The enemy heard I had extorted a treasure and they rushed me, to 
kill with anger The people who got into the RedMoon Valley on that 
day were affected by the RedMoonEvil, the origin of the demon, 
Consequently,madness of murder dominated their spirit. People 
murdered each others, enemies and friends alike the heaps of corpses 
blocked the way and the flow of blood became a river of red I 
managed to escape from it because I held a HolySword, a priceless 
sword, But I had murdered several people already by that time.
<Next/@Quest5>

[@Quest5]
#SAY
I tried to use anger against the RedMoonEvil, the terrible monster.
But anger and loathing can not beat demonic power. The minuet
I stabbed the RedMoonEvil I was showered with its blood and
promptly demon energy made me a demon of a man Because the 
HolySword could not protect me any more due to demon energy growning 
in my mind The HolySword also became a demon sword, a 
RedMoonSword. Ugh everything was my fault.
<Then how can I killed the RedMoonEvil/@Quest6>

[@Quest6]
#SAY
Although RedMoonEvil defeated me and the HolySword at the time,
The HolySword filled with taoist power injured RedMoonEvil fatally.
In spite of the passage of time, RedMoonEvil has not fully
recovered from the wound Therefore you who are not affected
with evil energy are able to kill the monster RedMoonEvil is a
demonic creature giving serious problems to the human community
We should get rid of it absolutely. Now keep in mind what I say
<Give me an order, Please./@Quest7>

[@Quest7]
#SAY
Since I became a demon of a man due to the blood of RedMoonEvil...
The RedMoonSword led me to wander over RedMoon Valley and 
Murder. Fighting and slaying for over 100 years when i faught against
a certain RedEvilApe the RedMoonSword was finally broken I recovered
my spirit from grasp of the huge demonic power and I aquired a
skill to let my soul remain even after my body Died. Now I would
like to ask you, get back the RedMoonChip and bring it to me
If left alone, other person will become a victim like me....
